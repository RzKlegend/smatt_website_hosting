SMATT - A Smart Attendance Management System

*This model is still in progress*

Currently the website has a feature to upload a particular batch of photos, get trained on it, and then using the faces that it has been trained on using Deep CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks), it identifies which face is which and marks them present. The ones not present in the face matching process, are marked as absent.

The face recognition model used in the website achieves a 99.38% accuracy towards identifying faces.
